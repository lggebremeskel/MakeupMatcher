# MakeupMatcher

## This is a project used to generate make-up shade recommendations to a user with a brand of their choice(Lancome, Fenty, or Dior). If you don't want to stand in line at the beauty store or want to shop online, then this is for you.

### Background

## Everyday, people spend a lot of time in beauty supply stores attempting to figure out the best make-up skin-tone match to their skin. Not only does the difficulty to find the best match lead to lines at stores, but it also makes it challenging to shop for make-up online. These difficulties are even magnified with Covid-19 restrictions. This program is designed to help alleviate these challenges and allow for people to shop online.
